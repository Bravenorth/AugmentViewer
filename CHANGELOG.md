## [0.2.0] - 2025-09-22

### Project Restructure & Architecture
- Adopted a feature-first layout under `src/features/items` with colocated components, utilities, and augment calculator modules.
- Added `src/app/layout/AppLayout.jsx` plus `Header.jsx` / `Footer.jsx` to centralise the shell and simplify the main entry point.
- Promoted shared UI into `src/shared/components/VersionBadge.jsx` and introduced `src/features/items/index.js` for clean barrel imports.

### Item Experience Improvements
- Item search now lists only augmentable entries via the shared `isAugmentable` helper.
- Item detail reuses the same helper and the relocated augment calculator + tooltip components.
- Level selector now derives labels from `augmentRequirements`, unlocking the full augment range.

### Augment Calculator Fixes
- Quick Study now shortens only the time estimate while material costs remain unchanged.
- Default material sources prioritise `craft.scrapping` (per-counter costs) before falling back to `craft.augmenting` totals.
- Removed market price fetching and simplified the summary to focus on materials, copies, and total time.

### Cleanup
- Removed obsolete comments/imports and the legacy `components/` tree remnants.
- Replaced random React keys in item cards with stable identifiers.
- Deleted the unused `useMarketPrices` hook and manifest data.

## [0.1.3] - 2025-05-22

### üßÆ Augment Calculator Enhancements
- **Summary UI refactor**:
  - Material lines now display:
    - `Log: 900 (Estimated) / 1000 (Max)`
    - `Gold: 169,200 ü™ô (estimated) / 188,000 ü™ô (max)`
  - Rounded values (no more decimals)
  - Clarified structure and improved alignment

- **Dual cost tracking**:
  - Clearly separated display for **estimated cost** (with critical/quick study effects)
  - And **maximum cost** (worst case with no procs)

- Added the ü™ô emoji to better represent currency visually

### üõë Item Detail ‚Äì Augmentability Check
- Non-augmentable items (missing `craft.augmenting`) no longer display the augment calculator
- Instead, a message is shown:
  > ‚ÄúThis item is not augmentable.‚Äù

### üîß Technical Fixes
- Fixed missing imports (`useMemo`, Chakra components) in `Summary.jsx`
- Rounded material quantities using `Math.round()` for accurate display and cost

## [0.1.2] - 2025-05-21

### UI / UX Enhancements
- Completely revamped `ItemStatTooltip` layout for better readability:
  - Sections now arranged in multiple responsive columns using `Flex` wrapping
  - Minimum width preserved to ensure consistent alignment across stat blocks
- Improved number formatting:
  - Removed unnecessary "+" for:
    - `Attack Speed` (now displayed as `3.1s`)
    - `Required Level` and flat stats like `strength`
  - Kept `+` sign for relative stats (e.g. affinities, bonuses)
  - All numeric values now consistently aligned right for clean vertical scan
- Visual refinements:
  - Hover effect (`bg: gray.700`) on table rows for better feedback
  - Monospace font applied for all numeric cells
  - Table layout now fixed for perfect alignment between keys and values

### Technical Refactors
- Extracted stat rendering logic into clean modular helpers:
  - `formatStatValue()` ‚Äî handles sign, suffix, and styling
  - `prepareTableRows()` ‚Äî flattens nested stats and filters out noise
- Added per-section control (`forceSign`) to toggle the sign logic dynamically

### Augment Calculator Rework
- Refactored `AugmentCalculator.jsx` into modular components:
  - `Main.jsx`, `LevelSelector.jsx`, `CounterInput.jsx`, `MaterialConfig.jsx`, `LevelTable.jsx`, `Summary.jsx`
- New folder structure under `src/components/AugmentCalculator/` for clean separation
- Rewired `ItemDetail.jsx` to import the new composed component
- Added `index.js` export for easy import

### New Functional Features
- Augment Time Estimator:
  - User-defined `Time per counter` in seconds (supports decimals like `2.5`)
  - `Critical augment chance (%)` field, reduces estimated time on proc (e.g. 10% chance to gain a +2)
  - `Quick Study` level (0‚Äì20), simulates progressive chances to skip counters (4% per level up to 80%)
  - Formula: estimated time = `effective counters √ó counterTime`
- Improved numeric field handling:
  - `CounterInput` now accepts and parses floating values with `.` or `,` (e.g. `10.5`, `10,5`)
  - Replaced Chakra's `NumberInput` with custom `Input + parseFloat` for better control

## [0.1.1] - 2025-05-18

### Optimizations
- Refactored `combined_items.json`:
  - Now indexed by item ID
  - Simplified and better aligned with in-game exposed structure
  - Removed unreliable and redundant keys

- Stat system rework:
  - Proper filtering of null or negligible stats (`0`, `"0"`, `null`, etc.)
  - Fixed value conversion for:
    - `offensiveDamageAffinity` (e.g. `1.33` ‚ûú `+33%`)
    - `hitMults` (e.g. `1.2` ‚ûú `+20%`)
    - `offensiveCritical` (e.g. `0.025` ‚ûú `+2.5%`)

### Components
- New: `ItemStatTooltip`
  - Displays all item stats in clean, modular sections
  - Subcomponents:
    - `StatGroup` ‚Äì generic stat renderer
    - `AttackSpeed` ‚Äì shows attack speed when applicable
    - `AugmentationBonus` ‚Äì handles augment-specific bonuses

- Integrated into `ItemDetail` (replaces legacy stat display)

### Layout (WIP)
- Iterated on UI layout:
  - Organized by section: core / offensive / defensive / augment
  - Switched between `SimpleGrid` and `Grid` to test compact formats
  - Styling and spacing refinements postponed for polishing later
